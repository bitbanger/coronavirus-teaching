# Liz Lawley's Spring 2020 Online Teaching Resources

I've been writing up a lot of brief guides for colleagues since the sudden shift to online teaching this semester, and I've decided to move them here so that they're more easily accessible, updatable, and shareable.

Feel free open issues or send pull requests if you think there are things that ought to be corrected or added. 

(And if the previous line sounds like gibberish to you, just email me at elizabeth.lawley@rit.edu if you think there are things that need to be fixed!)
